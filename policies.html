                    <p><h2>Publication Ethics And Malpractice Statement</h2></p>
                    <p>
                        „European Conference on Information and Intelligent Systems“ – CECIIS is committed to upholding the 
                        highest standards of publication ethics and takes all possible measures against any publication malpractices
                         for its double-blind peer-reviewed Conference Proceedings.
                    </p> <br><br>
                    <p><b>1. Duties of Editors and Track Directors</b><br>
                    Editors are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the academic record, 
                    for having processes in place to assure the quality of the material they publish 
                    and for precluding business needs from compromising intellectual and ethical standards.
                    Track Directors are responsible that appropriate reviewers are selected for submissions 
                    (i.e. individuals who are able to judge the work and are free from disqualifying competing interests).<br><br>
                    <b>Publication decisions</b><br>Editors and track directors are responsible for deciding which of manuscripts
                     submitted to CECIIS will be accepted for presentation and for publication of the final paper in the Conference 
                     Proceedings. This decision is based on the recommendation of reviewers. Main selection criteria are the 
                     contribution’s importance, originality and clarity, and the study’s validity and its relevance. Decision
                      will not be influenced by the authors' race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, 
                      citizenship, or political philosophy. Editors and track directors may be guided by the policies of the
                       CECIIS Program Committee and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding 
                       libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. Editors and track directors may confer with reviewers 
                       in making this decision. <br><br><b>Confidentiality</b> Editors and track directors must not disclose any
                        information about a manuscript submitted to anyone other than the corresponding 
                    author, reviewers, potential reviewers, other editorial advisers, and the publisher, as appropriate.<br>
                   <br><b> Disclosure and conflicts of interest</b>Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript will
                    not be used in an editors´ or track directors' own research without the express written consent of the author.<br>
                    <br><b>2. Duties of Reviewers</b><br><br><b>Contribution to editorial decisions</b><br>Papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings after double-blind peer-reviewed process. The reviewers advise track directors and editors. Track directors communicate with authors, as required, and help them in improving quality of their manuscript. The reviewers don't know the author's identity and reviewers' comments to track directors and editors are confidential and before passing on to the author will be made anonymous. The names of the reviewers remain strictly confidential; with their identities known only to editors and corresponding track director.<br>
                    <br><b>Promptness</b>Any selected reviewer who feels unqualified to review the research reported in manuscript or
                     knows that its prompt review will be impossible, should notify the track director and withdraw from the review 
                     process.<br><br><b>Confidentiality</b><br>Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential 
                     documents. They must not be disclosed to or discussed with others except as authorized by editors.<br>
                     <br><b>Standards of objectivity</b><br> Reviews should be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the
                      author is inappropriate. Reviewers should express their views clearly with supporting arguments, if necessary
                       with explanation.<br><br><b>Acknowledgement of sources</b><br>Reviewers should identify relevant published work
                        that has not been cited by authors. They should point out whether observations or arguments derived from 
                        other publications are accompanied by the respective source. Reviewers will notify track directors or editors 
                        of any substantial similarity or overlap between the manuscript under consideration and any other published 
                        paper of which they have personal knowledge.<br><br><b>Disclosure and conflict of interest</b><br>Privileged
                         information or ideas obtained through the review process must be kept confidential and not used for personal 
                         advantage. Reviewers should not consider manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from 
                         competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or 
                         institutions associated with the papers.<br><br><br>
                         <b>3. Duties of Authors</b><br><br><b>Reporting standards</b>Authors of manuscripts should present an
                          accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying
                           data should be represented accurately in the manuscript. A manuscript should contain sufficient detail 
                           and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements 
                           constitute unethical behavior and are unacceptable.<br><br><b>Data access and retention</b><br>Authors could be asked to provide the raw data in connection with a manuscript for review and should be prepared to provide public access to such data, if practicable, and should in any event be prepared to retain such data for a reasonable time after publication.<br><br>
                           <b>Originality and plagiarism</b><br>Authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, 
                           and if authors have used the work and/or words of others that this has been appropriately cited or quoted. 
                           Plagiarism in any form, including the touting of material contained in another paper (of the same authors 
                           or some other author) with cosmetic changes as a new paper; copying or paraphrasing substantial parts of 
                           another’s paper (without attribution), and claiming results from research conducted by others are among 
                           the numerous forms of plagiarism. In all its forms plagiarism constitutes unethical publishing behavior 
                           and is unacceptable.<br><br><b>Acknowledgement of sources</b><br>Proper acknowledgment of the work of 
                           others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have been influential in determining 
                           the nature of the reported work.<br><br><b>Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication</b><br>An author
                            should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one 
                            journal or primary publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal or conference 
                            concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behaviour and is unacceptable.<br><br>
                            <b>Authorship of the paper</b><br>Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant 
                            contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. 
                            All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there
                             are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the manuscript, they should
                              be acknowledged or listed as contributors.The corresponding author should ensure that all
                               appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the manuscript, and 
                               that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript and have agreed
                                to its submission for publication.<br><br><b>Fundamental errors in published work</b><br>
                                When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work,
                                 it is the author’s obligation to promptly notify editors or publisher and cooperate with
                                  editors to retract or correct the paper.If editors or the publisher learns from a third
                                 party that a published work contains a significant error, it is the obligation of the
                                   author to promptly retract or correct the paper or provide evidence to editrors of the 
                                  correctness of the original paper.<br><br><b>Disclosure and conflicts of interest</b>
                                  All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other substantive conflict
                                  of interest that might be construed to influence the results or interpretation of their
                                   manuscript. All sources of financial support for the paper should be disclosed.<br><br>
                                 <b>Publisher's confirmation</b><br>In cases of alleged or proven scientific misconduct, 
                                  fraudulent publication or plagiarism the publisher, in close collaboration with the editors,
                                 will take all appropriate measures to clarify the situation and to amend the paper in question.
                                  This includes the prompt publication of an erratum or, in the most severe cases, the
                                complete retraction of the affected work.<br>
